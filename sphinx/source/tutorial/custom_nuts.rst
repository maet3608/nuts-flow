Custom nuts
===========

>>> from nutsflow import *


Cheat sheet
-----------

A quick overview on how to create custom nuts.

nut_function
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **input**: single element
- **output**: single element
- **note**: number of elements in the data flow does not change

.. code::

  @nut_function
  def Inc(element, by):
      return element + by
      
  >>> Range(3) >> Inc(2) >> Collect()
  [2, 3, 4]  


nut_processor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **input**: iterable
- **output**: iterable (preferably a generator)
- **note**: number of elements in the data flow may change

.. code::

  @nut_processor
  def MyClone(iterable, n):  # more outputs than inputs
      for e in iterable:
          for _ in range(n):
              yield e        # generator!
      
  >>> Range(3) >> MyClone(3) >> Collect()
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] 

.. code::

  @nut_processor
  def MyPick(iterable, n):  # less outputs than inputs
      for i, e in enumerate(iterable):
          if i % n == 0:
              yield e
      
  >>> Range(9) >> MyPick(3) >> Collect()
  [0, 3, 6]
  
.. code::
  
  @nut_processor
  def Odd(iterable):
     return (e for e in iterable if e % 2)   # return <generator>!

  >>> Range(9) >> Odd() >> Collect()
  [1, 3, 5, 7]


nut_filter
^^^^^^^^^^

- **input**: single element
- **output**: single element
- **note**: number of elements in the data flow may change

.. code::

  @nut_filter
  def InInterval(element, a, b):
      return a <= element <= b
      
  >>> Range(10) >> InInterval(3, 6) >> Collect()
  [3, 4, 5, 6]  
  

nut_source
^^^^^^^^^^

- **input**: None
- **output**: iterable
- **note**: no input, must be at start of data flow

.. code::

  @nut_source
  def MyRange(n):
      return range(1, n+1)
      
  >>> MyRange(3) >> Collect()
  [1, 2, 3]  


nut_sink
^^^^^^^^

- **input**: iterable
- **output**: any
- **note**: processes/collects all data, should be at end of flow

.. code::

  @nut_sink
  def ToFmtList(iterable, fmt):
      return [fmt % e for e in iterable]
      
  >>> Range(3) >> ToFmtList('%02d')
  ['01', '02', '03']  
  


Basics & Examples
-----------------


**nuts-flow** can easily be extended with custom nuts using wrappers, 
decorators or derived classes. To clarify the differences between the
approaches let us start with a simple filter. First, import **nutsflow**

>>> from nutsflow import *

then define a ``lambda`` function that returns ``True`` for elements
greater than five

>>> greater_than_5 = lambda x: x > 5

and finally filter numbers using ``Filter`` and the defined ``lambda`` 
predicate 

>>> Range(10) >> Filter(greater_than_5) >> Collect()
[6, 7, 8, 9]

By wrapping the lambda function via ``nut_filter``, alternatively a custom
filter nut can be created

>>> GreaterThan5 = nut_filter(lambda x: x > 5)

that operates the same way but can be directly used as a nut

>>> Range(10) >> GreaterThan5() >> Collect()
[6, 7, 8, 9]

Note the change from lowercase for ``greater_than_5`` to uppercase 
for ``GreaterThan5`` to signify the change from a Python function
to a **nuts-flow** nut. This is strongly recommended to avoid
confusion on how to use a function or nut. Nuts are generally
in uppercase and invoked with brackets while Python functions are 
in lowercase, without brackets and passed on as parameters to nuts. 

For instance, both of the following examples are **invalid**. Here
``greater_than_5`` is confused as nut and invoked with brackets
instead of being passed as a value to ``Filter``

>>> Range(10) >> Filter(greater_than_5()) >> Collect()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: <lambda>() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)

Similarily in the following example ``GreaterThan5`` is invoked 
without brackets 

>>> Range(10) >> GreaterThan5 >> Collect()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for >>: 'Range' and 'type'


`Wrappers` such as ``nut_filter(...)`` are suitable for simple one-line 
functions with a single parameter but become less readable when 
additional parameters are required,  e.g. filtering with a given threshold

.. code::

  GreaterThan = nut_filter(lambda x, threshold: x > threshold)
  Range(10) >> GreaterThan(5) >> Collect()

In this case `decorators` are a better solution

.. code::

  @nut_filter
  def GreaterThan(x, threshold):
      return x > threshold

  Range(10) >> GreaterThan(5) >> Collect()
  
  
  
Invokation vs definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Note that for wrappers and decorators there is a difference in the 
arguments depending on whether the nut is *defined* or *invoked*

**definitions:**

.. code::

  GreaterThan = nut_filter(lambda x, threshold: ...)

.. code::

  @nut_filter
  def GreaterThan(x, threshold): ...
  

**invokation:**

.. code::

  x >> GreaterThan(threshold)

When *invoked* the first argument of the nut (here ``x``) appears as input 
on the  left side of the ``>>`` operator and the remaining parameters 
appear in brackets.

In rare (more advanced) cases custom nuts can be implemented
as classes derived from the relevant base classes (see ``base.py``).
Here an example implementation of the ``GreaterThan`` nut as a class

.. code::

  class GreaterThan(Nut):
      def __init__(self, threshold):
          self.threshold = threshold

      def __rrshift__(self, iterable):  # >> operator
          for x in iterable:
              if x > self.threshold:
                  yield x

However, decorators and wrappers are shortcuts to create nut classes 
and the preferred method to implement custom nuts.      		      


Nut types
---------

**nuts-flow** provides six different types of wrappers/decorators

- :ref:`nut_source`
- :ref:`nut_sink`
- :ref:`nut_function`
- :ref:`nut_processor`
- :ref:`nut_filter`
- :ref:`nut_filterfalse`


nut_source
^^^^^^^^^^

Typical cases for custom *nut sources* are the reading of files
in specific formats or wrappers around databases. Here
two toy examples for a wrapper and a decorator around a nut
that generates ``n`` even numbers. First the wrapper approach

>>> EvenNumbers = nut_source(lambda n: (2*x for x in range(n)))

and here the decorator version

.. code::

  @nut_source
  def EvenNumbers(n):
      return (2*x for x in range(n))

Both can be used as follows

>>> EvenNumbers(4) >> Collect()
[0, 2, 4, 6]


nut_sink
^^^^^^^^

Sinks receive an iterable and can return any result (not necessarily
an iterable). The following example re-implements the ``Join`` sink
that already exists in **nuts-flow** using a wrapper

>>> Join = nut_sink(lambda it, sep: sep.join(map(str, it)))

>>> Range(5) >> Join(':')
'0:1:2:3:4'

or using the decorator method

.. code::

  @nut_sink
  def Join(iterable, sep):
      return sep.join(map(str, iterable))

Note that while ``Join`` is a sink it returns an iterable (here a string)
and can therefore serve as input to other nuts

>>> Range(5) >> Join(':') >> Count()
9

The general rule is, if a nut collects/aggregates data in memory or
does not return an iterable result, it should be implemented as a *sink*
(despite being able to be input to other nuts). On the other hand,
if a nut processes data *on-the-fly* and returns an iterator it should
**not** be a *sink*.


nut_function
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *nut function* is a nut that is applied to each element in the data
flow and returns a result for each element. Consequently, when a nut
function is applied to a data flow the values of the elements change but
not their number. The following example function multiplies each element of
the data flow by ``n``

>>> Times = nut_function(lambda x, n: x * n)

and here the same function via a decorator

.. code::

  @nut_function
  def Times(x, n):
      return x * n

Usage is identical for both the wrapper and the decorator

>>> Range(5) >> Times(2) >> Collect()
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]


nut_processor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *nut processor* takes an iterable and returns an iterable but the  
number of elements in the output iterable can differ - this is different
to a :ref:`nut_function`.  If the numbers don't change both methods
can be used but a :ref:`nut_function` will be simpler. For instance,
here the ``Times`` nut re-implemented as a processor:

>>> Times = nut_processor(lambda iterable, n: (x * n for x in iterable))

Processors are needed if the number of elements in the flow changes, e.g.
here a processor nut that duplicates each element of the flow 

.. code::

  @nut_processor
  def Duplicate(iterable):
      for e in iterable:
          yield e
          yield e
  
  Range(5) >> Duplicate() >> Collect()
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]

or more generic, a processor that clones each element ``n`` times

.. code::

  @nut_processor
  def Clone(iterable, n):
      for e in iterable:
          for _ in range(n):
              yield e
  
  Range(5) >> Clone(2) >> Collect()
  [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]

Processors can be used to filter elements from a data flow but
typically the *filter nuts* described next are more appropriate
and easier to implement.


nut_filter
^^^^^^^^^^

As described above, *nut filters* extract elements from a data flow.
Here a nut that extracts all numbers that are in a given interval

>>> InInterval = nut_filter(lambda x, a, b: a <= x <= b)

and the same filter implemented using the decorator

.. code::

  @nut_filter
  def InInterval(x, a, b):
      return a <= x <= b

and how it is used

>>> Range(10) >> InInterval(3, 6) >> Collect()
[3, 4, 5, 6]


nut_filterfalse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally it is easier to implement a filter that extracts
element that are **not** meeting a given condition. The 
``nut_filterfalse`` wrapper/decorator is available for this 
use case. For instance, the following nut filters out all
elements that are **not** equal to given value

>>> Not = nut_filterfalse(lambda x, val: x == val)

or implemented via the decorator

.. code::

  @nut_filterfalse
  def Not(x, val):
      return x == val

and a usage example

>>> [1, 2, 3, 4] >> Not(2) >> Collect()
[1, 3, 4]

``nut_filterfalse`` is largely used to wrap existing predicate
functions as nuts. For example, given a function ``isnull(x)``
we can simply write  

.. code::

	IsValid = nut_filterfalse(isnull)  

which is shorter and more readable than

.. code::

	IsValid = nut_filter(lambda x: not isnull(x))
